                  “At the time, no single team member knew Go, but
within a month, everyone was writing in Go and we were
building out the endpoints. It was the flexibility, how easy it was to use,
and the really cool concept behind Go (how Go handles native concurrency,
garbage collection, and of course safety+speed.) that helped engage us
during the build. Also, who can beat that cute mascot!”
                  — Jaime Enrique Garcia Lopez,
                    Senior Software Development Manager

                  "A small language that compiles fast makes for a happy developer.
The Go language is small, compiles really fast, and as a result it lets your
mind focus on the actual problem and less on the tool you are using to solve
it. Code, test, debug cycles are so quick that you forget you are not
working with an interpreted language. Looking at our code, you see
less boilerplate and more business logic."

                    Lead Engineer, Open Shift

                  “Go has excellent characteristics for scalability and services
written using it typically have very small memory footprints.
Because code is compiled into a single static binary, services can also be
containerised with ease, making it much simpler to build and deploy. These
attributes make Go an ideal choice for companies building
microservices, as you can easily deploy into a highly available and
scalable environment such as Kubernetes.”

                  "In our tightly managed environments where we run Go code,
we have seen a CPU reduction of approximately 10%
with cleaner and maintainable code."

                  "Tooling has always been a problem with our legacy code base... but we have
 found that Go has excellent tooling, plus built-in testing, benchmarking,
 and profiling frameworks. It is easy to write efficient and resilient
 applications. After working on Go, most of our developers don't want
 to go back to other languages."
